# Java_String_Class

This project demonstrates the usage of -

- Static Variables
- Complex use of pointers
- Allocation and deallocation of memory space using pointers
- Use of the Cstring library for various functions

This project aims to simulate a Java String Class on C++. Simulating a String Literal Pool Class on C++ can save memory space and also enables more efficient string manipulation, such as string comparison. 

The assignment consists of three classes -

- String Data: Stores the number of references and the cstring received
- String Table: StringTable class stores a vector of objects of type StringData. This class is where all the important functions are defined and then called by the class MyString.
- MyString: MyString class receives index of every word and is capable of returning the string literal and printing the whole vector as well
